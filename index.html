            RFID door lock: The RFID Door Lock system is essentially a security mechanism that allows access to a door (or entry point) using an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag or card. When a valid RFID card is presented to an RFID reader, it checks if the card’s unique identifier (UID) matches one stored in a database or predefined list. If it matches, the door unlocks; if not, it denies access.

 We are using an Arduino Uno, RC522 RFID Reader, Relay Module, Solenoid Lock, Servo Motor, and buzzer.
            
            RFID Door Lock System Overview:
            RFID Reader (RC522):
            
            The RC522 is a popular RFID reader module that can read cards and tags operating at 13.56 MHz frequency.
            When a card is scanned, it returns a UID (Unique Identifier), which can be used for access control. This UID is stored in memory and compared to a predefined list of authorized UIDs to allow or deny access.
            Relay Module:
            
            The Relay Module is used to control high-power devices (like a solenoid lock) using a low-power control signal from the Arduino.
            When an authorized RFID tag is scanned, the Arduino triggers the relay to activate the solenoid lock, allowing the door to be unlocked.
            Solenoid Lock:
            
            A Solenoid Lock is an electromechanical device that locks or unlocks the door based on an electrical signal.
            When the relay is triggered by the Arduino, it supplies power to the solenoid, unlocking the door. After a predefined time, the solenoid may lock again, ensuring security.
            Servo Motor:
            
            The Servo Motor simulates the physical unlocking of the door by rotating a mechanism (like a latch) to open the door.
            After a valid RFID tag is scanned, the servo rotates to a predefined angle (e.g., 110°) to unlock the door and can be moved back to 0° to lock it again after some time.
            Buzzer:
            
            A Buzzer is used to give an audible signal when a wrong or unauthorized RFID tag is scanned.
            If an unauthorized RFID card is detected, the buzzer will sound for a short period to alert the user that access has been denied.
            RFID Door Lock Working Principle:
            Card Scanning: The RFID reader continuously scans for RFID cards or tags. When a card is brought within its range, the reader scans the card and reads its unique UID.
            
            UID Comparison: The Arduino compares the scanned UID against a list of authorized UIDs stored in the code. If the UID matches one of the authorized cards, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.
            
            Access Granted: When an authorized card is scanned:
            
            The Arduino sends a signal to the Relay Module, activating it for a short time.
            The Relay closes the circuit to the Solenoid Lock, unlocking it.
            The Servo Motor rotates from 0° to 110°, simulating the door opening.
            After a short delay (e.g., 2 seconds), the servo returns to 0°, simulating the door closing.
            The relay is turned off, locking the solenoid again.
            Access Denied: If an unauthorized RFID card is scanned:
            
            The system triggers the Buzzer for a brief period to indicate that access has been denied.
            System Workflow in Detail:
            Start-Up:
            
            The Arduino initializes the RFID reader, servo, relay, and buzzer.
            The system waits for an RFID tag to be scanned.
            Scan an RFID Card:
            
            The RFID reader detects a card and reads its UID.
            The Arduino compares the scanned UID with the stored authorized UIDs.
            Check Authorization:
            
            If the UID is authorized:
            The Relay activates, unlocking the Solenoid Lock.
            The Servo Motor rotates to 110° to simulate opening the door.
            After a delay, the Servo Motor rotates back to 0°, and the Relay is deactivated, locking the solenoid.
            If the UID is not authorized:
            The Buzzer sounds to indicate an incorrect card.
            Repeat:
            
            After completing the access attempt (either granted or denied), the system returns to waiting for the next RFID scan.</p>
